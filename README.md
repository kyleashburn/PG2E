This is a complex end to end Python (in progress)  project scraping a WordPress serial novel series ([A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/)) with Scrapy. 
Scraping was a complex process that includes a number of unique considerations. To protect the privacy and anonymity of users who commmented, I created UUIDs for each user with exception of the author of the chapters. Further, the scraper had to simultaneously scrape two data objects (chapters *and* commments). Finally, scraping had to be conducted on both a primary location of chapters as well as a secondary location for chapters. 

Post-scraping, analysis on a number of axes is being conducted including topic modeling with LDA (among other techniques), sentiment analysis, NER, periodicity analysis, and other textual analysis on the novel chapters as well as comments left on each chapter. I'm including various ipynbs (I'm overly fond of them as a format for my Python) that hold the code at each point in the project. This isn't going to be overly polished because it's still in progress.
