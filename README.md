This is a complex end to end Python (in progress)  project scraping a WordPress serial novel series ([A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/)) with Scrapy. Post-scraping, analysis on a number of axes was conducted including topic modeling with LDA (among other techniques), sentiment analysis, NER, periodicity analysis, and other textual analysis on the novel chapters as well as comments left on each chapter. I'm including various ipynbs (I'm overly fond of them as a format for my Python) that hold the code at each point in the project. This isn't going to be overly polished because it's still in progress.
